# VBA-Challenge


This macro loops through three separate worksheets that consist of stock data for different years. It summarizes the ticker, yearly change, % change, and total volume traded of each stock.
For each year, the macro also produces the ticker with the greatest and smallest % change, as well as the greatest total volume.

Please refer to the Multiple_year file for the original excel file and the VBS file or the txt file for the script.

png files 2018, 2019, 2020 shows the screenshot of each year.

Thank you.
